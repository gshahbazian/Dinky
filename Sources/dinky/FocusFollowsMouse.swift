// Focus follows mouse: a window the pointer comes to rest on takes focus. A listen-only tap sees mouse
// moves; at most every 50 ms the pointer is looked at, and only real movement counts, so windows moving
// under a still pointer (a retile, a Space switch) never take focus. The window must stay under the pointer
// for `delay-ms` before it is focused. Only windows dinky tracks count; panels, menus, the Dock and the
// desktop never do. After a Space change, a config load and an app activation hover did not cause (Cmd-Tab,
// a Dock click), hover parks until the pointer leaves the window it rests on: a hand on the mouse twitches, and
// that would focus the window being left and undo the activation. Leaving is judged against the windows as
// they are now, the one under the pointer against the one at the spot where it parked, so windows sliding or
// retiling under a still pointer never count. Main thread only.
